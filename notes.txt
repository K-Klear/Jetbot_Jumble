Notes:

- make shackles spawn more sensibly
- look into a better solution 

Ideas for special modes:
- Sumo (high gravity, spikes from sides, short chain)
- Sumo isometric (zero-G, spikes everywhere, short chain)
- Tumbler arena with "rotating" gravity
- Pickup race - points gained by picking up powerups, no death
- Limited fuel
- Madhouse (20 grav, high jet power, short-ish chain, spikes up and bounces elsewhere)
